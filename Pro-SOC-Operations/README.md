# Marliz Intel: Pro SOC Operations & Mastery
**Level:** Professional / Applied Engineering
**Mission:** Transforming raw telemetry into actionable battlefield intelligence.

## SOC Architecture Overview
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is defined by its data pipeline. The effectiveness of a SOC is directly proportional to its ability to ingest, parse, and correlate disparate log sources.
