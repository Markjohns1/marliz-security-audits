# Marliz Intel: Pro SOC Operations & Mastery
**Level:** Professional / Applied Engineering
**Mission:** Transforming raw telemetry into actionable battlefield intelligence.

## 🏗️ SOC Architecture Overview
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is defined by its data pipeline. The effectiveness of a SOC is directly proportional to its ability to ingest, parse, and correlate disparate log sources.

### Phase 1: Ingestion Pipeline
The focus is on the mechanics of data movement. This covers log shippers, aggregators, buffers, and normalization schemas. Without a structured pipeline, the SIEM remains a "Data Swamp" rather than an intelligence tool.

### Phase 2: Detection Engineering
The engineering of logic (rules) to identify malicious activity within the telemetry stream. We utilize industry standards such as Sigma (for SIEM), YARA (for files), and KQL (for cloud hunting).

### Phase 3: Tactical Threat Hunting
The iterative process of searching through networks to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. This is hypothesis-driven and relies on deep baseline knowledge.

### Phase 4: Incident Response
The procedural execution of containment, eradication, and recovery. This phase focuses on "The Kill Chain" and the playbooks required to neutralize active adversaries.
