# Chapter 5.5: The 24-Hour Healing Sprint: Pricing and Delivery

---

## The Panic Premium

When a specialized team is called in for an emergency, the price is not based on hours. It is based on value.
If a site making 100,000 KES a day is down, getting it up today is worth more than getting it up next week.

## The Pricing Models

### 1. The Audit (Discovery)
**Cost**: 10,000 - 30,000 KES
**Deliverable**: A report detailing the vulnerabilities.
**Effort**: 2-4 Hours.
**Strategy**: This is the "Footer in the Door." It is low cost enough for them to say yes without a board meeting.

### 2. The Healing Sprint (Remediation)
**Cost**: 50,000 - 150,000 KES
**Deliverable**: Fixing the code, hardening the server, setting up backups.
**Effort**: 24-48 Hours.
**Strategy**: This is the upsell. Once they see the scary report, they will pay you to fix it.

### 3. The Retainer (Assurance)
**Cost**: 15,000 KES / Month
**Deliverable**: Monthly scans, log monitoring, on-call support.
**Effort**: 2 Hours / Month.
**Strategy**: Recurring revenue. This is how you build a business.

## Getting Paid

**Rule 1**: 50% Deposit upfront. No exceptions for new clients.
**Rule 2**: Do not release the final hardened code until the final 50% is paid.
**Rule 3**: Use M-Pesa or Bank Transfer. Avoid PayPal (they freeze accounts).

## The Proposal Structure

"We propose a **24-Hour Healing Sprint** to neutralize the threat."
- Phase 1: Lockdown (Immediate blocking of attacker)
- Phase 2: Patching (Fixing the SQLi/RCE)
- Phase 3: Hardening (Firewall & Logs)

**Total Cost**: 80,000 KES.
**Timeline**: 24 Hours from receipt of deposit.

This urgency closes deals.
