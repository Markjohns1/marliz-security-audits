# Chapter 5.4: The Agency Persona: Sounding Like an Office

---

## The Credibility Gap

You are likely working from a bedroom in Nairobi, wearing shorts, listening to Afrobeats. The client is a CEO in Westlands wearing a suit.
If they visualize you as "some kid," they will not pay you. They will offer you "exposure."

You must construct the **Agency Persona**.

## 1. The Website

You need a landing page. It does not need to be complex. It needs to be dark, fast, and cryptic.
- **Name**: "Marliz Intel" sounds like a multinational defense contractor. "John's Hacking Services" sounds like a joke.
- **Content**: "Offensive Security," "Risk Assurance," "Penetration Testing." Words that accountants understand.

## 2. The Email

Never use `@gmail.com`.
Buy a domain. `reports@marlizintel.com`.
Use a signature.

**Example Signature:**
```
J. M. Oguta
Lead Security Analyst | Marliz Intel
Nairobi, Kenya
PGP Key: [Link]
Confidentiality Notice: This email contains sensitive security findings.
```

## 3. The "We"

Never say "I". Say "We".
"I found a bug" -> "Our automated scanners detected an anomaly."
"I can fix it" -> "Our team can deploy a remediation patch."

"We" implies infrastructure. "We" implies insurance. "We" allows you to charge corporate rates.

## 4. The Report

The deliverable is not the code. It is the PDF Report.
Use a template with a cover page. Use headers. Use a professional font (Inter or Roboto).
A 5-page PDF with a logo is worth 50,000 KES.
A WhatsApp message saying "fix your sql injection" is worth 0 KES.
