# Chapter 5.3: The Discovery Story: Explaining How You Found Them

---

## The Panic Moment

When you call a business owner and say "I found a bug," they hear "I hacked you." Their instinct is fear and aggression. "Who are you? Why were you probing my site?"

You need a cover story that frames you as the Good Samaritan, not the Threat.

## The "Student" Narrative

If you are young, this works best.
"Hello, I am a cybersecurity student doing a research project on Kenyan E-commerce safety. While analyzing public headers, I noticed your site is running an old version of PHP that exposes key files. I haven't touched anything, but I wanted to alert you."

**Why it works:** It sounds academic. It implies you were looking at *everyone*, not just them.

## The "Accidental Customer" Narrative

"Hi, I was trying to order a pizza on your site, but the cart kept crashing. Being a developer, I opened the browser console to see why, and I noticed your API was printing the database password in the error logs. You should really fix that."

**Why it works:** It puts you in the role of a user who wants the service to work.

## The Cold Hard "Audit" Narrative

If you are establishing an Agency brand (Marliz Intel), be direct.
"Good afternoon. I am John from Marliz Intel. We monitor the Kenyan IP space for leaks. Your IP `197.xx` was flagged in our system as exposing customer PII. We are notifying you as a courtesy."

**Why it works:** It sounds automated and professional. It reduces the personal aspect.

## The Cardinal Rule

**Never imply you were "testing" them without permission.**
"I tried to hack you and I succeeded" = Crime.
"I stumbled upon a leak while browsing" = Discovery.

Always frame the discovery as passive. "I saw the door was open," not "I tried the handle."
