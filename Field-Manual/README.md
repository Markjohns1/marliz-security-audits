## About This Book

This is not a textbook. This is a war journal.

Every chapter in this manual is based on real attacks, real defenses, and real money made from the cybersecurity trenches. We do not teach you theory. We show you what happens when a live adversary is scanning your server at 3 AM, and you have 10 minutes to stop them.

If you are a student tired of classroom lectures that do not match reality, this book is for you.  
If you are a developer who wants to stop building vulnerable systems, this book is for you.  
If you are a hustler who wants to turn security skills into consulting income, this book is for you.

Welcome to the Marliz Intel Field Manual.
