# Appendix E: The Marliz Code of Ethics

---

## The Oath of the Grey Hat

As analysts of Marliz Intel, we hold power over the digital lives of businesses in Kenya. With this power comes the obligation to act with integrity.

1.  **Authorization**: We never exploit a system for personal gain. We only demonstrate risk.
2.  **Privacy**: We never look at user data more than is necessary to prove the vulnerability. We never share, sell, or leak PII.
3.  **Transparency**: We tell the client the whole truth. We do not hide vulnerabilities to ensure future work.
4.  **Education**: We teach the client how to defend themselves. We do not rely on their ignorance for our job security.
5.  **Restraint**: We do not destroy. We do not delete. We do not disrupt service unless authorized for a stress test.

## Violations

Any analyst found violating this code will be immediately terminated and reported to the relevant authorities under the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act.

**Signed:**
John Mark Oguta
Director, Marliz Intel
